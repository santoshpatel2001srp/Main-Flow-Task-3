# Household Data Visualization

This repository contains Python code for visualizing household data using Pandas and Matplotlib. The dataset includes information on various attributes related to households.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Data
The dataset is stored in a CSV file (`householdtask3.csv`). It includes the following columns:
- `year`: The year of data collection
- `tot_hhs`: Total number of households
- `own`: Number of households that own property
- `own_wm`: Number of households that own a washing machine
- `own_prop`: Percentage of households that own property
- `own_wm_prop`: Percentage of households that own a washing machine
- `prop_hhs`: Percentage of households that own property
- `age`: Average age of household members
- `size`: Average household size
- `income`: Average household income
- `expenditure`: Average household expenditure
- `eqv_income`: Equivalent income
- `eqv_exp`: Equivalent expenditure

## Visualizations
1. **Scatter Plot (year vs own)**: Shows the relationship between the year and the number of households that own property.
2. **Scatter Plot (tot_hhs vs prop_hhs)**: Illustrates the relationship between the total number of households and the percentage of households that own property.
3. **Line Chart (own_wm vs own_prop)**: Compares the ownership of washing machines and property.
4. **Line Chart (own_wm_prop vs prop_hhs)**: Compares the percentage of households with washing machines and property ownership.
5. **Bar Chart (year vs own)**: Displays the number of households that own property over the years.
6. **Bar Chart (age vs size)**: Compares the average age of household members with the household size.
7. **Histogram Chart (income)**: Shows the distribution of household income.
8. **Histogram Chart (expenditure)**: Displays the distribution of household expenditure.
9. **Histogram Chart (eqv_income)**: Illustrates the distribution of equivalent income.
10. **Histogram Chart (eqv_exp)**: Shows the distribution of equivalent expenditure.
